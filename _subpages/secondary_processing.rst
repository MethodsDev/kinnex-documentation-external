Secondary Processing
====================
The cleaned s-read obtained from the Primary analysis can then be aligned to reference genome using  minimap2 `(publication link here)<https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/18/3094/4994778>`_.
As good practice the aligned reads should be QCed 

   - `minimap2 <https://lh3.github.io/minimap2/minimap2.html>`_ for aligning reads
   - LongRNAseqQC : (link page here in toctree)
   - MDLgenomeview for inspecting read support (link notebook here)
