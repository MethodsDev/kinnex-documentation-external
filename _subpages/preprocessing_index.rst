Analysis workflows
==================
The analysis workflows for Kinnex products are similar for pre-processing with a few tweaks in parameters, and diverge there after. 
The preliminary processing mainly leverages various applications from PacBio Analysis Toolkit. 
Most workflows have WDL wrappers publicly accessible via Dockstore with test data and reference files to follow along placed in public requester-pays Google Storage bucket.
