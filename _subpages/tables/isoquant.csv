inputBAM,this.minimap2_bam,"Replace ""minimap2_bam"" with the column that contains the path to the input BAM file in the sample table."
inputBAMindex,this.minimap2_bam_index,"Replace ""minimap2_bam_index"" with the column that contains the path to the input BAM file's index in the sample table."

noModelConstruction,"""false""","This should be set to ""false"" if you want de novo reconstruction of transcripts for reads that don't match any reference transcript, or to ""true"" if you want to disable reconstruction"
sampleName,this.sample_id,"Replace ""sample_id"" with the column that contains the name of the samples in the sample table."
dataType,"""pacbio_ccs""","Type of reads provided, one of ""pacbio_ccs"" or ""pacbio"", ""nanopore"" or ""ONT"" ""assembly"" or ""transcript"""

readGroup,"""tag:CB""",(Optional) How to group reads in the feature counts matrix outputs. Can be in the form of:
,,"""tag:CB"" groups reads by BAM file read tag, for example cell barcode CB"
,,"""read_id:_"" groups reads by read name suffix: set read_id:DELIM where DELIM is the symbol/string by which the read id will be split"
reportWhetherCanonical,"""false""",(Optional) Report whether read or constructed transcript model contains non-canonical splice junction (requires more time).
