The PacBio Kinnex™ full-length RNA kit takes total RNA as input and 
outputs a sequencing-ready library that results in an 8-fold throughput increase 
compared to typical IsoSeq libraries.

`Application Note <https://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/Application-note-Kinnex-full-length-RNA-kit-for-isoform-sequencing.pdf>`_

Quick Notes:

• Input 300 ng total RNA, RIN ≥7
• Generate up to 12-plex barcoded cDNA using (Iso-Seq express 2.0 kit)
• 2-day Kinnex library preparation using Kinnex full-length RNA kit 
• Barcoded Kinnex adapters support up to 4-plex multiplexing
• Total 48 samples per flowcell
• ~40 million cDNA sequences

Here is a schematic representation of the multi-plexing scheme:
