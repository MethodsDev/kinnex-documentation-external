The PacBio Kinnex™ single-cell RNA kit takes as input single-cell cDNA and outputs a sequencing-ready library that
results in a 16-fold throughput increase compared to
regular single-cell Iso-Seq® libraries. More details on the sequencing platform can be found here: `PacBio's Single Cell FAQs <https://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/applications/rna-sequencing/single-cell-rna-sequencing/>`_
